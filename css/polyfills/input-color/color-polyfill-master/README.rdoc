= Color polyfill

This is a polyfill for implementing the HTML5 <tt><input type="color"></tt> element in browsers that do not currently support it.

== Usage

Using it is easy â€” simply include the +color-polyfill.js+ file in the HEAD of the HTML page. You can then use <tt><input type="color"></tt> elements normally.

If Modernizr detects that the browser doesn't support <tt><input type="color"></tt>, the script will replace these elements with a JavaScript-powered color picker dialog.

A default CSS file is provided. You may edit this file to style the buttons and dialog box to make them look the way you want.

If Modernizr detects support for CSS transitions, you will be able to animate the opening and closing of the dialog box by writing a CSS transition in the CSS file. Otherwise, a jQuery animation is used.

== Dependencies

This script requires jQuery[http://jquery.com/], jQuery UI[http://jqueryui.com/], and Modernizr[http://www.modernizr.com/].
